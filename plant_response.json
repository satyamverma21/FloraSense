It is native to Southeast Asia, China, the Indian Subcontinent, Papuasia, Australia, and the island of R\u00e9union.The name Breynia is a conserved name, it is recognized despite the existence of an earlier use of the same name to refer to a different plant. Breynia L. 1753 is in the Capparaceae, but it is a rejected name. We here discuss Breynia J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. 1776.In a 2006 revision of the Phyllanthaceae, it was recommended that Breynia be subsumed in Phyllanthus; however, new combinations in Phyllanthus for former Breynia species remain to be published.Breynia are of special note in the fields of pollination biology and coevolution because they have a specialized mutualism with moths in the genus Epicephala (leafflower moths), in which the moths actively pollinate the flowers\u2014thereby ensuring that the tree may produce viable seeds\u2014but also lay eggs in the flowers' ovaries or in the space between the tepals and the carpel walls, from where their larvae consume a subset of the developing seeds as nourishment. Other species of Epicephala are pollinators, and in some cases, non-pollinating seed predators, of certain species of plants in the genera Phyllanthus and Glochidion, both closely related to Breynia. This relationship is similar to those between figs and fig wasps and yuccas and yucca moths.\n\nSpeciesBreynia baudouinii Beille \u2013 Vietnam\nBreynia calcarea (M.R.Hend.)

It is estimated that there are at least over 1,000 species, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world.

The exact number is difficult to tell as some plants have been recorded several times with different names and new species continue to be discovered. Peperomias have adapted to many different environments and their appearance varies greatly. Some are epiphytes (growing on other plants) or lithophytes (growing on rock or in rock crevices), and many are xerophytes (drought-tolerant) either with thick succulent structures or with underground tubers (geophytes). Most species are compact perennial shrubs or vines.The genus name Peperomia was coined by Spanish botanists Ruiz L\u00f3pez and Pav\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez in 1794 after their travels in Peru and Chile. Peperomia plants do not have a widely accepted common name and some argue that it is better to use the genus name, as is the case with genera such as Petunia and Begonia.
